# Car Price Prediction ML

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts car prices using the **Automobile dataset**.  
It explores **simple and multiple linear regression, polynomial regression, scaling, and pipeline implementation**.  
The analysis visualizes relationships between car features and price, evaluates model performance, and predicts prices for new inputs.

## 🛠️ Key Steps
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Simple linear regression with `highway-mpg`  
- Multiple linear regression with features like `horsepower`, `curb-weight`, `engine-size`, `highway-mpg`  
- Polynomial regression and residual analysis  
- Scaling and pipeline implementation using `StandardScaler` and `PolynomialFeatures`  
- Model evaluation using R² and RMSE
